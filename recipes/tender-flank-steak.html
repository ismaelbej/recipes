    <p>Learn how easy it is to make a flavorful and tender flank steak on the grill — just marinate it overnight in a mixture of garlic, soy sauce, and Worcestershire. You may want to add a pinch of salt if you are using a low-sodium soy sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) flank steak</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add flank steak, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove flank steak from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the grill until slightly pink in the center and beginning to firm, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
        <li>Slice against the grain to serve.</li>
    </ol>
